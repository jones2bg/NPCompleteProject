# Approximate Solution

## Running All Test Cases
Run run_test_cases.sh with no arguments to run all provided test cases.

```
./run_test_cases.sh
```

## Running Individually
Run approximate_TSP.py and provide the time to run as well as the interval at which to print out the approximation as arguments, both as milisecond values, and provide an input graph and selected starting node on stdin.

```
./approximate_TSP.py 3000 500 < test_cases/small/3_node.txt
```
